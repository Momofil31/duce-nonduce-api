# Duce-Non Duce API

Inspired by the great TV show game "Duce/Non Duce" invented by the italian comedian Valerio Lundini, this API classifies a provided image as Duce or Non Duce.

It uses a Binary Classifier built with PyTorch (Resnet18) and trained on a dataset composed of 237 images of Benito Mussolini (aka The Duce) and other common objects, animals, people and landscapes.
